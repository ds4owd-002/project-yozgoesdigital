	abstract = {This package contains two data resources. `trips` contains the GPS locations of faecal sludge emptying trucks collecting sludge from pit latrines and septic tanks in Kampala, Uganda. Each trip is recorded with a unique identifier, the numberplate of the truck, the date and time of the record. Data was collected from 30th March 2015 until 25th June 2015. `trucks` has additional information on the volume of each truck.},

	abstract = {In this opinion article, we present the Trans‐African Hydro‐Meteorological Observatory (
              TAHMO
              ). The goal of
              TAHMO
              is to develop a dense network of hydro‐meteorological measurement stations throughout sub‐Saharan Africa. On average, there will be one station per 1000 km
              2
              . The stations will be cost‐effective through the use of new sensor and communication technologies. The station design is robust and aims at minimizing maintenance. Special attention will be paid to data quality assessment and control. Through public–private partnerships, the system will be made financially self‐sustaining. Education will play an important role as many stations will be placed at schools, where they will play a role in the curriculum.
